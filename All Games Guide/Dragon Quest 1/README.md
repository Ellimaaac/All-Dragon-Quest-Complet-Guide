# Chapter 1: Delivering the Princess

## Radatome Castle

The King receives you to explain what your quest will consist of. The King will tell you how far you've progressed in Dragon Quest I and how many experience points you'll need to reach the next level. After listening carefully, open the chests to obtain 120 gold coins, a torch and a magic key that will allow you to open the door to the South. You can also speak to the King's advisor, who will tell you about Princess Laura, and to the soldiers, who will give you lots of advice. Once you've done that, open the door and go down the stairs. In one of the jars to the east, you'll find an herb that will heal your wounds.
Now that you're ready to see the world, leave the castle and head for the town to the east.

## Radatome Village

First of all, head to the merchant to the north and buy the Club and Plain Clothes to equip yourself better. The Dragon Scales from the merchant to the east will also be useful, as will a torch or two. Next, you'll find a Wing of Chimera in a cupboard in the inn to the south. You can then start training so that you can stand up to the monsters of the world. Leave the town and wander the green pastures around the castle until you reach level 3/4, to obtain the 'Heal' spell, which heals you, and the 'Fireball' spell, which lets you shoot fireballs. Don't stray too far, fighting only Slimes or Red Slimes, and rest at the augerge regularly.
Once you've done that, don't forget to save the game by going back to talk to the King. You can also recover all your magic points by talking to the old man to the east of the ground floor. Now it's time to pay your respects at the tomb of your ancestor Roto, the legendary hero.

## Roto Cave

To reach his tomb, simply head north from the castle. You can find the entrance to a cave in a small desert, taking care of the surrounding monsters. Once you return, you will be able to breathe, you will not meet anyone there. Then light your torch to see something there, and head to the South-East, where you will take some stairs. There, walk the walls to Roto's tomb, and read his will. He will explain to you what you must do to defeat evil, namely find his sword and his legendary armor. Once done, return to town and rest. Fight until you have enough money to buy a Leather Shield and Leather Clothes. You are now well equipped to set off on an adventure. Onward to Garai!

## Garai Town

The town of Garai is located far north of Radatome Castle. Continue north after Roto Cave and head towards the western plains to reach it. This city is not very interesting at the moment, but you can still do some exploring there. It is therefore advisable to buy the Copper Sword there if you can afford it. The other amenities are still too expensive for you.... You will come back to this city later. After going around the town and talking to the inhabitants, you can either head towards the news that awaits you, or return to the castle to save, which we advise you to do.... Now, head to Maira!

## Marai Town

This town is quite far away, so be sure to be equipped as we have advised you, otherwise you will probably not come out alive... Maira is located to the east of the town of Garai. Starting from this, continue east then head slightly south to cross two bridges. After the second, head north. You will encounter the first monsters worthy of the name, like Sage or Giant Scorpion. Be very careful and do not hesitate to cast your "Fireball" spell. You should be able to see the town right in the middle of a forest. There you will discover on the ground, on a shiny point, the Fairy Flute, which will be obligatory for the rest of the adventure.

You can also find Plain Clothes as well as a Strong Seed in the shelves near the hot springs where a young woman offers you her "Puff-Puff" services... Use this seed immediately to develop your strength. After talking to the people present, go back... and train, until you reach level 8. All these fights will allow you to earn enough gold coins to buy an Iron Ax and possibly an Iron Armor. For the most motivated, it is also interesting to buy an Iron Shield in Garai but know that you can find one for free in the area we are going to describe: the mountain caves. Don't forget to save with the king and take advantage of this passage to go to the town of Radatome and store the Fairy Flute at the depot which will not be useful for a while.

## The mountainous caves

### Magic Nut
Mountain caves are easy to find and are an optional location. You don't have to do them now, or even after. However, we advise you to do so in order to find an Iron Shield! To do this, head to Garai by crossing the first bridge, then go south until you can't go down anymore, then head east. You should find some purple swamps, don't step on them or you'll get hurt. Continue east to find the entrance to the caves.

### Ground floor
As soon as you arrive, light a torch or use your "Radiant" spell. Then head west from the waterhole, go south then continue west as soon as you can. Then go north and you will see some pillars. Then continue east until you are blocked, then south. You will be stuck, go west then south. There will then be a crossroads with four directions, take the east one. Then follow the wall towards the south. You will eventually find a watering hole. To the west is a chest containing 343 gold coins.

Continue south then west. In this corner there is a door, you can ignore it, we will use another passage. Then head north until you find some pillars. Follow them, go along the wall and take the stairs.

### Basement
Once in the basement, head east, you can find chests in two recesses containing 537 gold coins and a torch respectively. Sometimes it is possible that in the first chest you will find the Cursed Necklace (one chance in thirty-two!). It has no use in the game aside from its very high selling price at over 1000 Gold. Continue east then south, where you can find a chest surrounded by torches containing a magnificent Iron Shield. To the west of this room is a second chest at the end of a beautiful red carpet, in which you can find the Warrior's Ring. Then continue towards the South-West to find a chest with a Strength Seed and a last one with a Magic Nut. Use them right away. Then exit the cave, either with the Outside spell or on foot. It's time to go visit the town of Rimuldar via the Marais caves!

Note: From this moment you will be able to equip both the Dragon Scales to have a defense bonus, as well as the Warrior's Ring to be more effective in attack. We recommend equipping both, but carrying both items at the same time will take up space in your inventory. So store the Fairy Flute in the Radatome town depot in the inn if you haven't already done so, or the Medical Herbs which will no longer be very useful to you since you learned to heal yourself with them. Magic.

### The Marais caves
These caves are located south of Maira, in the middle of a swamp. You will therefore necessarily lose life points before entering, be careful! They are very easy to navigate, no need to use a torch. Indeed, once inside, all you have to do is continue south until you get stuck. Then continue to follow the walls towards the south, then when you are blocked again, head towards the West to find stairs. Take them to get out of the caves. For the adventurers who have explored the cave, you may have found a door there that you will not be able to open for the moment, it can still wait a little... You are not yet ready for what is hiding behind!

## Rimuldar Town
Once outside, head west, go down a bit, then travel south through the forest. Watch out for the surrounding monsters that you find in the forests, which are quite strong, like the Wolf. If you encounter Iron Scorpions, use Fireball to defeat them, as they are very resistant to physical attacks. If you run out of magic, don't be brave and run away.

You will find Rimuldar on a peninsula. In this town you will obtain a Wing of Chimera in a wardrobe, next to a young woman changing... This town is very interesting and quite essential to continue the adventure because you find a Magic Keys merchant. You will thus be able to open the doors of the game, including that of the caves which we have already spoken about. To find it, when you are in Rimulda, do not enter the town straight away and continue north, where there is a lonely girl. Then continue west and you will find the entrance to the building.

Buy as many keys as possible (six maximum). Also search the pots in this store to get 120 gold and a Defense Seed to use right away. You can then use two keys to open the city gates to obtain a Nut of Life, which we advise you to use immediately too. Now it's time to see what lies behind the door of the rock caverns... But first, you need to prepare yourself physically. Save, and train diligently (the surroundings of Ridulmar are a good place) to reach level 11/12. Also buy a Steel Sword and a Steel Armor if you don't have one on you yet. Note that to the south of the city is the sacred temple, which currently has no use. It is therefore normal that you are teleported to its entrance if you try to speak to its guardian, a mysterious old man who patiently awaits the arrival of the descendant of the legendary hero...

## Return to the Marais caves
You should definitely save before venturing into these caves, as you may never return. It's time to save Princess Laura... So return to the rock caverns and starting at the top, follow the eastern walls and go down. You will be faced with a door that you can open with a Magic Key. Behind her is the Green Dragon! He is very powerful, and you will have difficulty defeating him if you are not well prepared. Here, brute force will be key, attack him constantly and heal yourself every three turns or so.
