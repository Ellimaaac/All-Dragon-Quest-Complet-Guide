# Chapter 1: Delivering the Princess

## Radatome Castle
The King receives you to explain what your quest will consist of. The King will tell you how far you've progressed in Dragon Quest I and how many experience points you'll need to reach the next level. After listening carefully, open the chests to obtain 120 gold coins, a torch and a magic key that will allow you to open the door to the South. You can also speak to the King's advisor, who will tell you about Princess Laura, and to the soldiers, who will give you lots of advice. Once you've done that, open the door and go down the stairs. In one of the jars to the east, you'll find an herb that will heal your wounds.
Now that you're ready to see the world, leave the castle and head for the town to the east.

## Radatome Village
First of all, head to the merchant to the north and buy the Club and Plain Clothes to equip yourself better. The Dragon Scales from the merchant to the east will also be useful, as will a torch or two. Next, you'll find a Wing of Chimera in a cupboard in the inn to the south. You can then start training so that you can stand up to the monsters of the world. Leave the town and wander the green pastures around the castle until you reach level 3/4, to obtain the 'Heal' spell, which heals you, and the 'Fireball' spell, which lets you shoot fireballs. Don't stray too far, fighting only Slimes or Red Slimes, and rest at the augerge regularly.
Once you've done that, don't forget to save the game by going back to talk to the King. You can also recover all your magic points by talking to the old man to the east of the ground floor. Now it's time to pay your respects at the tomb of your ancestor Roto, the legendary hero.
