The hero's identity remains a mystery. We don't even know his name, or what he's really after in this quest. Very few people believe in him and his descent from the famous hero Roto, who once saved the world. But it is the blood of a brave man that runs in his veins, and the King of Radatome, in his wisdom, understood this. The hero was the only one brave enough to take the initiative in rescuing Princess Laura, who was being held prisoner by a terrible dragon. His courage goes so far as to defy the mighty Lordragon. At the start of the adventure, the hero pays his respects at Roto's tomb, eventually proving his worth by finding his ancestor's equipment.

Laura is a beautiful and candid young woman. Like all princesses, she is waiting for her hero to come to her and make her happy... However, this is not what fate had in store for her, as she is kidnapped by a sinister Dragon, controlled by Lordragon. She was then his prisoner, left in the depths of a cave. All she could do was wait to die, but her dream came true when the hero came to save her. Grateful, she promised him her undying love, and proved it by giving him her pendant, so that she could always talk to him, wherever he was

The origin of the Lordragon remains very unclear... It is thought that he was an old hermit who had grown tired of life and wanted to end his existence by challenging a dragon. To his great surprise, he was able to control it and obtain all its powers. Faced with so much power, his soul darkened... And so he became Lord of the Dragons. With the help of an army of dragons, he immediately attacked Radatome castle, setting the country on fire and capturing Princess Laura... Now he waits wisely in his tower for the brave men who will dare to challenge him before he puts an end to his evil plans for conquest...
