# Prologue
Once you've entered your nickname and selected your gender, you'll be asked a series of questions to find out what kind of person you are. Once you've done this, you'll be sent to a place where you'll have to emerge. It won't be difficult, but it will once again help to define you. Once all these tests have been passed, the voice that asked you so many questions will be able to tell you what your personality is... It is at this point that your mother pulls you out of this strange dream.

# Chapter 1: From father to son

## Aliahan Castle
It's the first day of your sixteenth birthday. Once your mother has left your room, open the bedside table drawer and pick up a strength seed. Then join your mother, who will order you to follow her to the King's castle. Do as she asks and go to see your sovereign in the castle. During your audience, you will learn that your father, the hero Ortega, died in battle. 

The king asks you to take up his quest where he left off, to kill the demon Baramos and restore peace to the world. To get your adventure off to a good start, the king will give you weapons, armour and 50 gold coins.
Now it's time to search the castle. From the throne room, enter the room at the bottom left of your screen and open the second drawer, which contains a Luck Seed. You can then go back down to the ground floor. Sneak into the wing.
You may have noticed that you can't open certain doors. These can only be opened when you have the corresponding keys. Don't worry, we'll find those keys later in the adventure. In the meantime, get out of the castle. Now we can search the town.
Start by returning home. In the first barrel on the ground floor is a medical herb. Upstairs, go into the room of the old man, your grandfather, and open his drawer, which contains 5 gold coins.

Go to the south-east of the town and you'll see a well. Go inside, then go through the door of the house there. This is the Medal King's Mansion. This is where you can exchange the small medals you've found for rewards. A book in the library will tell you what rewards are available.

You can now open the barrel located to the north-west of the town next to the tavern. You can reach it by going around the tavern. The barrel contains 25 gold coins. Then enter the tavern. This is a very important place, as it's here that you'll be able to shape your team. What's special about this episode is that you can choose your travelling companions, as well as their jobs. Jobs allow characters to specialise. So you can create several characters on the floor that might be of interest to you (you can boost their stats with five free seeds for each character you create). To add them to your team, you'll need to hire them from the stand on the ground floor. To get the adventure off to a good start, we recommend that you take a mage and a cleric with you.
### The night
In the house to the east of the town, you'll find a 'small medal' hidden in one of the drawers upstairs.

## Najimi Tower
This is on the island to the west of your castle. To reach it, you will have to cross a cave. You can reach the entrance by following the shore of the inland sea to the west.

You'll find a medical herb in a hidden corner of the cave, as well as traveler clothes and 56 gold coins. In the basement of the tower, a chest contains 32 gold coins in a hidden area to the north. Then reach the ground floor via the south staircase. Continue upwards, and if you're feeling too weak, take a trip to the inn in the tower. Otherwise, enter the hidden area to the east and go upstairs.

On the first floor, the chests will give you 40 gold coins and a small medal. To get to the second floor, take the stairs to the south-west in a hidden area. Enter the hidden area behind which is the staircase that leads to the old man who will give you the thief key. Search his bookcase too, as it contains a Tomboy book. You can now leave the tower or open the doors to the basement, behind which are an agility seed and a wooden helmet. You can also open some of the doors to Aliahan Castle (where you'll find a small medal).

## The village of Reeve
You can reach this village by heading north-west. Let's start by searching the area from top to bottom. You'll first find a muscle book in the library of the house to the north of the village.

Then enter the detached house to the north-east of the village. Look in the pots and you'll find a wisdom seed. Go upstairs and speak to the old man so that he can give you the magic ball. Don't forget to look in his bedside table, where you'll find a herb antidote.

You can now leave the Aliahan region. To do so, head south-east. Start by entering the house on the plain. Inside you'll find a 'wing of chimera' and a 'small medal'. Then enter the ***Cave of Enticement***.

## Cave of Enticement
On the first level.Stand in front of the wall between the two statues and use your magic ball.The wall will explode, clearing the way for you. Open the chest just behind the wall (or what's left of it), which contains an important item: the magic map.Then take the stairs.Make your way to the far north of the level, then enter the hidden area to the west to get the herb antidote.Finally, enter the eastern hidden area to continue towards the exit. Once you've left the exit, search the various hidden areas on either side of the wall for a ***sacred knife***.

Once you've done this, head for the northernmost hidden area. Inside, take the stairs leading downwards.There are now three paths open to you. Only the one to the west will allow you to leave the cavern. To do this, take the teleporter. This will take you to the exit staircase. You will then arrive at Romaly Castle. Go there.
