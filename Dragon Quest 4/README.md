## Main Story

## Chapter 1: The Epic of Ragnar McRyan
In this first chapter, players are introduced to Ragnar McRyan, a knight of Burland. The King entrusts Ragnar with the mission of tracking down Psaro the Butcher, the thief of the Zenithian Sword. Ragnar, accompanied by his friend Cristo, sets off in search of justice. On their journey, they meet the vivacious Alena, a warrior princess who seeks to defy royal convention. The team gradually comes together and discovers that Psaro's motives run deeper than mere theft. They uncover royal plots and buried secrets, and prepare for the challenges ahead.

### Boss 

| No. | HP | MP | Attack | Defense | Agility | XP | Gold | Object |
|-----|----|----|--------|---------|---------|----|------|--------|
| 195 | 250| 0  |   52   |   36    |   16    | 73 | 60   | None   |

**Recommended Level and Team**: Ragnar, Doc (Level 9)

**Tips to Defeat the Boss**: 
Have the best possible equipment: the burning sword you find in the tower, iron armor, wooden helmet, iron shield (important, allows to reduce spell damage). Don‚Äôt forget to restore your HP/MP at the goddess statue before the boss, and put two or three herbs on Ragnar as a precaution.

Start by destroying the critter that accompanies him and focus on him. He can cast flame (quite high damage on one character), blow fire (rather weak damage on all) or physically attack (quite strong). Don‚Äôt trust your companion too much in case of a hard hit, it happens that he attacks or defends instead of healing‚Ä¶ so if his hp or yours are low, don‚Äôt hesitate to use a herb. The boss should not resist too long anyway.

## Chapter 2: The intrepid merchant, Torneko Taloon
The focus shifts to Torneko Taloon, an ordinary merchant with extraordinary aspirations. Torneko quits his job to pursue his dream of owning his own shop. Players follow his adventures through dangerous dungeons as he collects treasure and learns the tricks of the trade. Torneko becomes an endearing character, and his story shows that even heroes can have ordinary professions.

## Chapter 3: The mystical world of Meena and Maya
Twin sisters Meena and Maya seek revenge against Balzack, their father's murderer. Their quest takes them through mystical lands, populated by monsters and magical mysteries. Meena, a magician with psychic powers, and Maya, an agile dancer, form a formidable team. Together, they discover hidden truths about magic and the origins of their world.

## Chapter 4: The Chosen Hero
The previous chapters converge on the Chosen Hero, a silent character that players can customise. The Hero brings together the characters from the previous chapters, forming a motley crew. They learn that Psaro the Butcher is not the true antagonist, but rather a person in search of redemption after the loss of his beloved. The team embarks on a journey to save the world, discovering key elements of the story and facing increasingly powerful adversaries.

## Chapter 5: The World of Darkness
Les h√©ros d√©couvrent l'existence d'un monde souterrain dirig√© par Estark, une force mal√©fique. Ils doivent collecter des artefacts sacr√©s pour renforcer leur pouvoir et obtenir l'alliance des monstres opprim√©s par Estark. Ce chapitre met en avant des batailles √©piques, des moments de sacrifice et des r√©v√©lations sur l'histoire ancienne de leur monde. Les enjeux atteignent un sommet alors que l'√©quipe se pr√©pare √† affronter Estark.

## Chapter 6: The Epic Conclusion
The final chapter sees the group take on Estark in an epic battle to save the world. Psaro the Butcher realises the true meaning of love and sacrifice, bringing an emotional dimension to the story. After intense battles, moments of reflection and difficult choices, peace is finally restored to the world. The heroes return to their daily lives, forever scarred by the trials they have overcome.
