## Main Story

### Chapter 1: The Epic of Ragnar McRyan
In this first chapter, players are introduced to Ragnar McRyan, a knight of Burland. The King entrusts Ragnar with the mission of tracking down Psaro the Butcher, the thief of the Zenithian Sword. Ragnar, accompanied by his friend Cristo, sets off in search of justice. On their journey, they meet the vivacious Alena, a warrior princess who seeks to defy royal convention. The team gradually comes together and discovers that Psaro's motives run deeper than mere theft. They uncover royal plots and buried secrets, and prepare for the challenges ahead.

### Chapter 2: The intrepid merchant, Torneko Taloon
The focus shifts to Torneko Taloon, an ordinary merchant with extraordinary aspirations. Torneko quits his job to pursue his dream of owning his own shop. Players follow his adventures through dangerous dungeons as he collects treasure and learns the tricks of the trade. Torneko becomes an endearing character, and his story shows that even heroes can have ordinary professions.

### Chapter 3: The mystical world of Meena and Maya
Twin sisters Meena and Maya seek revenge against Balzack, their father's murderer. Their quest takes them through mystical lands, populated by monsters and magical mysteries. Meena, a magician with psychic powers, and Maya, an agile dancer, form a formidable team. Together, they discover hidden truths about magic and the origins of their world.

### Chapter 4: The Chosen Hero
All the previous characters join forces under the banner of the Chosen Hero, a mute character whose goal is to assemble a diverse team to save the world.
